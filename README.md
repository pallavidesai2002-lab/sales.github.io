Customer Support Ticket Analysis and Resolution Time Prediction
1. Introduction
Customer support plays an important role in keeping customers satisfied. When tickets are resolved quickly, customers trust the service more. This project focuses on analysing customer support tickets and understanding how different factors affect ticket resolution time. The goal is to study ticket patterns and build simple machine learning models to predict ticket resolution behaviour.
2. Objective of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
•
To analyse customer support ticket data
•
To understand how ticket priority, type, agent, and category affect resolution time
•
To predict ticket resolution time using Linear Regression
•
To classify tickets as fast or slow resolution using Logistic Regression
•
To draw meaningful insights that can help improve customer suppor
